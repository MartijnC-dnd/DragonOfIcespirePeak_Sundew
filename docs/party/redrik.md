## Background

**Gambler** / **Never Tell Me the Odds**

## Personality Traits

Nothing is certain. Planning is a coward’s act.

## Ideals

Fate. Whatever happens is fated, regardless of any planning or striving. (Lawful)

## Bonds

I’m loyal to the friend or family member who taught me how to gamble.

## Flaws

You can loan me a little, right? I’ve got a sure thing. I’ll double your money, guaranteed.
